Supposing that you have the following requirements:

A file located at /home/your-username/your-project/folder/file.ext opened in your editor;
The directory /home/your-username/your-project opened as your root workspace.
So you will have the following values for each variable:

${workspaceFolder} - /home/your-username/your-project
${workspaceFolderBasename} - your-project
${file} - /home/your-username/your-project/folder/file.ext
${fileWorkspaceFolder} - /home/your-username/your-project
${relativeFile} - folder/file.ext
${relativeFileDirname} - folder
${fileBasename} - file.ext
${fileBasenameNoExtension} - file
${fileDirname} - /home/your-username/your-project/folder
${fileExtname} - .ext
${lineNumber} - line number of the cursor
${selectedText} - text selected in your code editor
${execPath} - location of Code.exe
${pathSeparator} - / on macOS or linux, \\ on Windows
